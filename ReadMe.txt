    APPLICATION : libu3dspv/u3dplayer Project Overview
========================================================================
libu3dspv - Universal 3D Space Properties Viesualizer 
system independent library (Windows/linux) to visualize nodes, 
they positions, velocities and properties (ie. temperature). 
This lib allows to visualize computations during run-time, 
play data in loop and store it to file from Fortran code. 

u3dplayer -  Universal 3D Player (Development / Unusable - plays only out.u3d file)
multiplatform application (Windows/linux) to play data stored with libu3dspv in file.

On windows after loading solution some changes in paths would be needed.
